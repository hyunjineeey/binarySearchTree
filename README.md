##  Binary Search Tree (Insert Floor, Delete Floor, Find Nearest Floor)

Due to a breakthrough in paranormal detection technology, you have discovered that the 20-story hotel that you have recently purchased is full of ghosts.  They particularly seem to enjoy throwing ghost parties in the elevator lobbies on each floor, which is causing you to lose customers who freak out when they see the decorative furniture in those lobbies move around on its own.  You put in a call for some professional ghost busters, but they’re backlogged for months so you need a temporary solution.  The issue of preventing guests from encountering ghosts on their way down from their rooms has already been solved by installing a massive slide that extends from the top floor down to the street level; who would want to use the elevator over a giant slide?  The problem is that this has only increased the demand for elevator use on the way up.

Your strategy is the following: keep a record of which floors are not currently being haunted, using your ghost sensors, and then reprogram the elevators to take guests to the floor nearest to the one requested that isn’t occupied by ghosts.  The guests can then use the stairs or the giant slide to get to their true destination, and since neither of those is attached to the elevator lobbies, it should avoid the problem.  Since this strategy requires quickly updating the list of safe floors as the ghosts move throughout the building, you have decided to use a Binary Search Tree to keep track of the data.
